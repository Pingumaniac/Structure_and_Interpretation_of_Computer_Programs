# Notes

Made notes of things that I have found interesting.

* "In a nondeterministic language, expressions can have more than one value, and, as a result, the computation is dealing with relations rather than with single-valued functions. (438)"
* "Logic programming extends this idea by combining a relational vision of programming with a powerful kind of symbolic pattern matching called unification. (438)"
