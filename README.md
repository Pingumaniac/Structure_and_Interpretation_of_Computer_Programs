# Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs
This repository contains my solutions to all of the exercises from the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. These include:
1. implementing an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme dialect of Lisp that uses normal-order evaluation instead of applicative-order evaluation for Section 4.2
2. implementing an interpreter for non-deterministic computing for Section 4.3
3. implementing an interpreter for logic-programming language for Section 4.4
4. implementing a simple compiler that translates Scheme programs into sequences of instructions that can be executed directly with the registers and operations of the evaluator register machine for Section 5.5

Note that this is my first personal project for summer 2023 break.
