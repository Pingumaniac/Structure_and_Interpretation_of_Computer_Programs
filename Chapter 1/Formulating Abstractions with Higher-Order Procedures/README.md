Made notes of things that I have found interesting.

## About first-class status

"In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated.
Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have first-class status. Some of the "rights and privileges" of the first-class elements are:

* They may be named by variables
* They may be passed as arguments to procedures
* They may be returned as the results of procedures
* They may be included in data structures

Lisp, unlike other common programming languages, awards procedures full first-class status. This poses challenges for efficient implementation, but the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous. (76-77)"
