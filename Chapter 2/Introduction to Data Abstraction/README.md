# Notes

Made notes of things that I have found interesting.

## Data abstraction 

"identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed, and then use only those operations in manipulating data. (87)"

## What is data?

"some collection of selectors and constructors, together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid representation. (90-91)"
