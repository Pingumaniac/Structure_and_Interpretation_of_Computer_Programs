# Notes

Made notes of things that I have found interesting.

* Environment = a place where the value of a variable is stored (236)
* Environment = "sequence of frames (237)"
* Bindings = "associate variable names with their corresponding values (237)"

"Each frame also has a pointer to its enclosing environment,
unless, for the purposes of discussion, the frame is considered to
be global. The value of a variable with respect to an environment is the
value given by the binding of the variable in the first frame in the environment
that contains a binding for that variable. If no frame in the
sequence specifies a binding for the variable, then the variable is said to
be unbound in the environment. (237)"

"ÓÅâe environment is crucial to the evaluation process, because it determines
the context in which an expression should be evaluated. Indeed,
one could say that expressions in a programming language do not, in themselves, have any meaning. 
Rather, an expression acquires a meaning only with respect to some environment in which it is evaluated. (237-238)"


"Even the interpretation of an expression as straightforward as (+ 1 1) 
depends on an understanding that one is operating in a context in
which + is the symbol for addition. Thus, in our model of evaluation we
will always speak of evaluating an expression with respect to some environment.
To describe interactions with the interpreter, we will suppose
that there is a global environment, consisting of a single frame (with no
enclosing environment) that includes values for the symbols associated
with the primitive procedures. For example, the idea that + is the symbol
for addition is captured by saying that the symbol + is bound in the
global environment to the primitive addition procedure. (238)"
