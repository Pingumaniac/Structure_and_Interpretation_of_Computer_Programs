# Notes

Made notes of things that I have found interesting.

* delayed evaluation -> "enables us to represent very large (even infinite) sequences as streams (317)"
* "Stream processing lets us model systems that have state without ever using assignment or mutable data. (317)"
* "Unfortunately, if we represent sequences as lists, this elegance is
bought at the price of severe inefficiency with respect to both the time
and space required by our computations. When we represent manipulations
on sequences as transformations of lists, our programs must
construct and copy data structures (which may be huge) at every step
of a process. (317)"
