# Notes

Made notes of things that I have found interesting.

* "using cons to construct lists will result in an interlinked structure of pairs in which many individual pairs are shared by many different structures (257)"
* "sharing is completely undetectable if we operate on lists using only cons, car, and cdr. However, if we allow mutators on list structure, sharing becomes significant. (258)"
* event-driven simulation = "actions (“events”) trigger further events that happen at a later time, which in turn trigger more events, and so on (273)"
