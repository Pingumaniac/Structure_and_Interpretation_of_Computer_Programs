# Notes

Made notes of things that I have found interesting.

## Roles of the linkage descriptor

1. "continue at the next instruction in sequence (this is specified by the linkage descriptor next) (571)"
2. "return from the procedure being compiled (this is specified by the linkage descriptor return) (571)"
3. "jump to a named entry point (this is specified by using the designated label as the linkage descriptor) (571)"

## 3 pieces of information in the instruction sequence

1. "the set of registers that must be initialized before the instructions in the sequence are executed (these registers are said to be needed by the sequence) (573)"
2. "the set of registers whose values are modified by the instructions in the sequence (573)"
3. "the actual instructions (also called statements) in the sequence (573)"
