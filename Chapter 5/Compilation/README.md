# Notes

Made notes of things that I have found interesting.

## Roles of the linkage descriptor

1. "continue at the next instruction in sequence (this is specified by the linkage descriptor next) (571)"
2. "return from the procedure being compiled (this is specified by the linkage descriptor return) (571)"
3. "jump to a named entry point (this is specified by using the designated label as the linkage descriptor) (571)"
